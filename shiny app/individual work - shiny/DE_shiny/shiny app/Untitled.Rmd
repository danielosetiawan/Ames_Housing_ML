## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = read_csv('mfData.csv')

df = type.convert(df, as.is=FALSE)

df = df %>% select(-Prop_Addr)
str(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
X = missForest(df, maxiter = 10, ntree = 100, variablewise = FALSE,
                       decreasing = FALSE, verbose = FALSE,
                       mtry = floor(sqrt(ncol(df))), replace = TRUE,
                       classwt = NULL, cutoff = NULL, strata = NULL,
                       sampsize = NULL, nodesize = NULL, maxnodes = NULL,
                       xtrue = NA, parallelize = c('no', 'variables', 'forests'))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
